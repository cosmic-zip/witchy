# Security Policy

Although we do our best to prevent vulnerabilities, and have tools to help
catch most of them, we are humans after all, and there will be inevitably
issues slipping through the cracks.

They can fall into two categories, either in any of the tools in the
witch_craft suite, or in our presence online (website, forum, emails,
DNS, etc.).

Depending on which category they fall into, different information is
needed. We do believe in coordinated disclosure, so in order to address them, and
coordinate disclosure with you (and properly credit you for the
discovery), report them to us. Do not open bug reports or pull requests.
